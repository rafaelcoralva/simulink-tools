# simulink-tools
Mixed simulink libraries and tools, mainly for the processing of physiological signals (ECG + SCG) in Simulink.
Contains the WIP custom "CardioLab" library: a series of blocks and their components to load and process ECG and SCG signals via the use of Simulink and Matlab functions (from the matlab-scg-tools and matlab-ecg-tools repos).
To get a complete overview of CardioLab, open FullCardioLabModel.slk.
